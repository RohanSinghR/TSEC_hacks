# Credit Chain

A layer2 DeFi solution for asset management, to execute Will of users (written in smart contracts) and to manage wallets and NFT's.
  


## The Feautures of this Application

1) Execute WILL of users and transfer assets (cryptocurrency and NFT) 
--
--
2) Access control of WILL is given through smart dual keys generated by the app (one of which is given to the benificiary and other to a centralized authority like LIC)  after the expiry of the user only if both keys are supplied the contract exeutes
--
--

Example:
if the user decides to transfer digital assets into FIAT currency like Rupee or Dollar, the centralized authority will preform the necessary conversion and transfer the funds to the necessary beneficiaries
--
--

3) provide a medium for transaction of different coins linked to the same wallet
--

4) A platform for staking funds and to recive a return of funds similar to reciving interest
